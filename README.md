## Prerequisites
* Make sure you have [nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
* (Optional) Create a dedicated folder for all your LBDserver downloads.

## Installation
* (option 1a: using [git](https://git-scm.com/download)) - run `git clone https://github.com/LBDserver/front-react.git` in your favourite terminal, in your favourite folder.
* (option 1b: using ZIP folders) - Go to the CODE button at the top of the repository and click `Download ZIP`. Extract the folder.
* Once the repository is extracted, run `npm install` to install the necessary modules. This may take a while.
